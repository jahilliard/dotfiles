### My .gitconfig file automatically includes this file for me in all my local git repos, but that does not carry over to offsite repos like github

# Ignore the stupid .DS_Store that Mac OS X leaves
.DS_Store

# Ignore all log files
*.log

# Ignore all tmp directories and files
tmp/**/*

# Ignore db files (rebuild and repopulate each time)
*.sqlite3
